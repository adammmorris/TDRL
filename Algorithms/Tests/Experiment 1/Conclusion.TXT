WHAT WE DID

- Optimized alphaR/alphaP and betaR/betaP over a deterministic board under 2x2 different conditions
The conditions were:
	equal punishments vs. double punishments
	hard randomized vs. soft randomized
Board2 = equal punishments & hard randomized
Board2_soft = equal punishments & soft randomized
Board3 = double punishments & hard randomized
Board3_soft = double punishments & soft randomized

- In all of these, we:
Assumed gammas
Found optimal temps
Using optimal temps & constant, undifferentiated betas, optimized differentiated alphaR/alphaP
Using optimal temps & constant, undifferentiated alphas, optimized differentiated betaR/betaP
Using optimal temps & optimal, differentiated betas, optimized differentiated alphaR/alphaP
Using optimal temps & optimal, differentiated alphas, optimized differentiated betaR/betaP

- Also tried optimizing differentiated tempR/tempP

WHAT WE FOUND

1) Under all conditions, the optimal alphaR is much higher than the optimal alphaP.
alphaP might as well be 0.

2) Under all conditions, the optimal betaR was something like .1 or .2 (low).
The optimal betaP was anywhere from .1 to 1.  In fact, it also might as well have been 0 (the program only did slightly better when jumping from betaP = 0 to .1).
