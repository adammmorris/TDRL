Optimization 1 on Board2 soft randomized (Apr 5, 2013):
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		AlphaR = .5, alphaP = 0
		Temps = .3
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		betaR between .2 and .3
		betaP between .1 and 1
		fvals ~ 1480 to 1520
		max fval was (.2, 1, 1525.8)
	You could get about a 35 increase by setting betaR > betaP
