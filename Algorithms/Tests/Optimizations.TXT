- These are all on the human board, Board13 (using ac_sep_twosteptask)

Reward system only:
- Maximized alphaR & betaR*tempR, holding all punishment params at 0
- Best:
alphaR = .4
betaR * tempR = 1

Punishment system with accurate reward params:
- Maximized alphaP & betaP * tempP, setting alphaR = .4 and betaR * tempR = .4
This is not strictly accurate, b/c with the subjects betaR*tempR was more like .03 lol
But go with it.. I screwed up :P
- Best:
alphaP = 0
betaP * tempP = 1

Punishment system with optimal reward params:
- Maximized alphaP & betaP * tempP, setting alphaR = .4 and betaR * tempR = 1
- Best:
alphaP = 0
betaP * tempP = 1
