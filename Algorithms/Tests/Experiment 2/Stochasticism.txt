LONG TERM:

Each time you shift, randomly decide whether each state is going to go up or down

If up:
	Shift according to a normal distribution around 30% increase
		mean: 30%	
		std_dev: 15%
If down:
	Shift according to a normal distribution around -30% increase
		mean: -30%
		std_dev: 15%
		
SHORT TERM:

Each time you get a reward, shift according to a normal dist around 0% increase
	mean: 0%
	std_dev: 5%
	
Also, at beginning, give each state a different % chance of switching signs on any given turn
	(assuming risk, and higher reward -> risk of higher punishment)
