Optimization 1:
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		Betas = .1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: alphaR, alphaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		alphaR between .2 and .6
		alphaP = 0
		fvals ~ 1220
		max fval was (.3, 0, 1225.9)
		
Optimization 2:

		Alphas = .1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1

Optimization 3:
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		Alphas = optimal from opt 1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		betaR = .1
		betaP between .1 and 1
		fvals ~ 1480 to 1500
		max fval was (.1, .1, 1286.2)
	You could do about 0 better by having betaP > betaR
		
Optimization 4:
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		BetaR = .2, BetaP = .2
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: alphaR, alphaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		fvals were same as Opt 3
