- What brought the alphaR down to .3 was specifically the LT stochasticism; w/ just ST, it was back up to .8
And no difference for the betas
And taking away long-term LT actually reduced asymmetry in temps

To try:
- Try more fine-grained analysis on temps
- See if I can bring out whatever asymmetry there is
	W/ the usual tricks
	By setting lower temps for the beta analysis
- Check the variability on that asymmetry (to see if, even small, it might make a difference)
