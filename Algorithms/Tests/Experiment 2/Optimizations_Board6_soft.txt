Optimization 1 on Board6 soft randomized:
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		Betas = .1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: alphaR, alphaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		alphaR between .2 and .4
		alphaP = 0
		fvals ~ 1415
		max fval was (.4, 0, 1426.3)

Optimization 3 on Board6 soft randomized:
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		AlphaR = .4, alphaP = 0
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		You could do about 50 better by having betaP > betaR
