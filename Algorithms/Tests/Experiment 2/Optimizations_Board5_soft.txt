Optimization 1 on Board5 soft randomized (Apr 11, 2013):
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		Betas = .1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: alphaR, alphaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		alphaR between .2 and .6
		alphaP = 0
		fvals ~ 1400
		max fval was (.3, 0, 1412.2)
		
Optimization 2 on Board5 soft randomized (Apr 11, 2013):

Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		betaR between .2 and .5

Optimization 3 on Board5 soft randomized (Apr 11, 2013):
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		AlphaR = .4, alphaP = 0
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		betaR = .1
		betaP between .1 and 1
		fvals ~ 1480 to 1500
		max fval was (.1, .7, 1501.2)
	You could do about 80 better by having betaP > betaR
