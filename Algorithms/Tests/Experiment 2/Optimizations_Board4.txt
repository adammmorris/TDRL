Optimization 1 on Board4 hard randomized (Apr 10, 2013):
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		Betas = .1
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: alphaR, alphaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		alphaR between .3 and .9
		alphaP between 0 and .1
		fvals ~ 1310 to 1340
		max fval was (.6, 0, 1341.1)

Optimization 3 on Board3 hard randomized (Apr 10, 2013):
Setup
	Method: mapping
	Variables
		Gammas = .85
		AlphaR = .6, alphaP = 0
		Temps = .6
		Optimizing over: betaR, betaP
	param_step = .1
	numPlays = 50
	numInstances = 10000
Result
	fvals: see data in Values folder, graph in Graphs folder
	max:
		betaR between .1 and .2
		betaP between .1 and 1
		fvals ~ 1350
		max fval was (.1, .6, 1375.9)
	You could only do about 30 better by having betaP > betaR
