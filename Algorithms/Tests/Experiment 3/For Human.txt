FOR HUMAN EXPERIMENT

Opt 1/2:
- numPlays = 50
- Map_temp_undiff
w/ betas [.1 .1]
- Map_AB
w/ optimal temp and betas [.1 .1]
stochasticsm: short term, std_shift = 25
- Results:
maxtemp = 1

Opt 3:
- This was w/ Board13
Basically an imitation of Daw's 2-step task (in order to help analyze Fiery's data)
- Properties:
stochasticTransitions = 1
multiplyByFive = 0
- Undifferentiated Betas: hardly any improvement after .5
Undifferentiated Alphas: same thing (best score around 85-88)
- Differentiated alphas:
MUCH better when AlphaP = 0
Best alphaR between .5 and 1 (best score around 105-110)

Opt 4:
- This is again w/ Board13
Except this time transforming it to our purposes
- Properties:
stochasticTransitions = 0
multiplyByFive = 0
- Same as Opt3

Opt 5:
- Same as Opt4 in setup, except w/ random drifting instead of static drifting
- Results: same as opt3 (best was .5,0)
