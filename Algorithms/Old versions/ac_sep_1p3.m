% ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS

% Board properties.
% Board is built in 2s_builder, and is stored in 2s3_boards.
% Board variables we get from the boards file:
%   numStates (# of states)
%   numMoves (# of moves each agent makes)
%   numActions (# of choices at each agent decision point)
%   numBoards (number of agent-board systems to be instantiated and played
%       through separately)
%   boards - boards(state_i, board_k) = the reward from state_i in board_k
load 2sp3_boards.mat

% Start properties.
% Right now, only one starting position.
% starts = randsample(1:width,numBoards,true); % starting location for agent

% State transition matrix.
% From 2s_transitions.mat
% Variables we get:
%   transitions - transitions(state_i, action_j, board_k) is the state arrived at after
%       taking action_j at state_i in board_k.
