%% ac_sep_comb_2steptask
% This is the separated actor/critic model for a two-step task
% This version uses a 'combined' actor/critic that switches its parameters
%   for rewards and punishments, but keeps one combined matrix of values &
%   policies
% Note that it can be used with other environments too, but some of the
%   features (i.e. stochastic transitions, the 'results' output) won't work

%% Params
% x should be either:
%   [alphaR alphaP betaR betaP temp gammaR gammaP]
%   or a numInstance x 1, where each row is that vector (for each subject)

%% Output
% earnings is numInstances x 1
% negLLs is numInstances x 1
% results is (numInstances * numPlays) x 5
%   columns are id a1 s2 a2 re

%% Versions
% v3: cleaning up code (i.e. getting rid of drifting rewards in here, cause
%   its now in the board itself)

function [earnings, negLLs, results] = ac_sep_comb_2steptask_v3(x, numInstances, numPlays, boardPath, stochasticTransitions)

%% ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS

% Board properties.
% Board variables we get from the boards file:
%   boards - boards(state_i, board_k) = the reward from state_i in board_k
%   transitions - transitions(state_i, action_j, board_k) is the state arrived at after
%       taking action_j at state_i in board_k.
%   numStates (# of states)
%   numMoves (# of moves each agent makes)
%   numActions (# of choices at each agent decision point)
%   numBoards (number of agent-board systems to be instantiated and played
%       through separately)
