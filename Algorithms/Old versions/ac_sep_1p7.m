% Fiery's Separated Actor-Critic Learning Algorithm
% Inputs:
%   x = [alphaR, alphaP, betaR, betaP, tempR, tempP]
%   numInstances (optional) = the number of times to run the algorithm (i.e. the
%       number of board-agent instances to run through)
%       default: numBoards

function [totEarnings, stdEarnings, learnCurve] = ac_sep_1p7(x, numInstances)

% ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS

% Board properties.
% Board variables we get from the boards file:
%   boards - boards(state_i, board_k) = the reward from state_i in board_k
%   transitions - transitions(state_i, action_j, board_k) is the state arrived at after
%       taking action_j at state_i in board_k.
%   numStates (# of states)
%   numMoves (# of moves each agent makes)
%   numActions (# of choices at each agent decision point)
%   numBoards (number of agent-board systems to be instantiated and played
%       through separately)

[currentPath, ~, ~] = fileparts(mfilename('fullpath'));
load(strcat(currentPath, '/Boards/Board3/Board3_soft.mat'));

if nargin < 2
    numInstances = numBoards;
end

% Do I want it to be stochastic?
% Set stochastic to 0 if no
% If yes, set stochastic like this:
%   If you want there to be a 10% chance of multiplying the reward by 10,
%   set stochastic = 10;
stochastic = 0;

% Start properties.
% Right now, only one starting position.
% starts = randsample(1:width,numBoards,true); % starting location for agent

% AGENT PARAMETERS

% Set gammas, alphas, betas, temps

%x0 = [.5 .5 .8 .5 .5 .8 1 1]; 
%for i = 1:length(x)
%    if x(i) < 0 % has to be this, because what if you want one of the values to be zero?
%        x(i) = x0(i);
%    end
%end

% Temporal discount rates have been chosen based on my review of the literature, which seems
%   to indicate people choose the gammas to be somewhere between .75 and .99
gammaR = .85;
gammaP = .85;

% All the learning rates have been set to .1
% Why .1?
%   Most papers seem to set it anywhere from .01 to .15
%   I went with the high end b/c the low end seemed to produce very poor
%   results
% Why the same for critic & actor learning rates?
%   That's what most of the literature seemed to do
alphaR = x(1);
alphaP = x(2);
betaR = x(3);
betaP = x(4);

% Temps have been set to .6
% Got this from optimization w/ learning rates = .1 (see results)
tempR = x(5);
tempP = x(6);

% Set the # of plays each agent gets to make.
numPlays = 50;

% Set up initial state/action preference matrix (actor) and initial value
%   matrix (critic)
policy0 = zeros(numStates,numActions);
values0 = zeros(numStates, 1);

% Set up earnings matrix.
earnings = zeros(numPlays,numInstances);
