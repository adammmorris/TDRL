% This script builds Board12
% Board12 is single-tier, punishments are doubled, equal frequency of rewards and
%   punishments - w/ multiple branches of all punishments
% (This is Board8 with doubled punishments)

% BOARD PARAMETERS

numMoves = 2; % # of decision points for the agent

% Different types of randomization
% randomized = 0 -> no randomization
% randomized = 1 -> "soft" randomization
%   this means to keep each tree separate, and randomize intra-tree and
%   inter-tree without mixing
% randomized = 2 -> "hard" randomization
%   this means to completely randomize where the rewards are
randomized = 1;
