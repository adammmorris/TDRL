% This script builds Board10
% Board10 is 4-level, values on levels 2-4, fully randomized (but segregated
%   by level)

% BOARD PARAMETERS

numMoves = 3; % # of decision points for the agent
numLevels = numMoves + 1; % # of levels - this is not including end state
numActions = 4; % # of options at each decision point

% Calculate # of states

% Different types of randomization
% randomized = 0 -> no randomization
% randomized = 1 -> "soft" randomization
%   this means to keep each tree separate, and randomize intra-tree and
%   inter-tree without mixing
% randomized = 2 -> "hard" randomization
%   this means to completely randomize where the rewards are
