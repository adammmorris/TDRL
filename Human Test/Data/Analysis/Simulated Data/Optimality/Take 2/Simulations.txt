Alpha-BetaTimesTemp:
- alpha x beta*temp
- best was alpha = .3, beta*temp = 2

Beta-Temp:
- beta x temp (using alpha = .3)
- best was anything past beta=.3,temp=1

BetaR-BetaP:
- betaR x betaP (using alpha = .3, temp = 2)
- best was betaR=.5, betaP=.9

AlphaR-AlphaP:
- alphaR x alphaP (using betaR = .5, betaP = .9, temp = 2)
- worked :)
